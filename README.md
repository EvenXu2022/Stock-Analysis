## Summary

### Refactoring Code
The Advantages of the refactoring code is an efficient code with faster performance. The Disadvantages of the refactoring code is that this code requires certain database structure which won’t fit in all situations.

### Original vs Refactoring
The refactoring code is an efficient code with easy understanding; however, this code is more suitable if the databased is organized in a certain way; however, it won’t work if the tickers lists in a random way. 
The original code is fitting in any situation of the database structure; however, comparing the refactoring code, it’s a little hard to understand and with long performance time.
